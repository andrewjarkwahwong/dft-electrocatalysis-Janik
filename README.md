# dft-electrocatalysis-Janik
 Tools supporting recent DFT electrocatalytic work in the Dr. Mike Janik group

The purpose of this repository is to provide tools derived from the models and DFT frameworks for modeling electrocatalytic reactions. 

Tools are, not limited to, Jupyter notebooks, Google colab, and Google sheets for ease of use.

All tools will have the attached paper for further readings about the theory and frameworks.

Current tools are as follow:
1. Electrochemical activation barrier calculator with Electrochemical double layer consideration
