# dft-electrocatalysis-Janik
 Tools supporting recent DFT electrocatalytic work in the Dr. Mike Janik group

The purpose of this repository is to provide tools derived from the models and DFT frameworks for modeling electrocatalytic reactions. 

Tools are, not limited to, Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, Google collab, and Google sheets for ease of use.

All tools will have the attached paper for further readings about the theory and frameworks.

Current tools are as follows:
1. Calculating Electrochemical activation barrier and quantifying electrode-electrolyte interfacial effects
    a. Our paper in Journal of Catalysis can be read here to learn more about the methodology. 
2. Quantifying the Symmetry Factor as a function of the EDL properties and the electronic properties. 
    a. Our paper in Nature Catalysis can be read here regarding the application of this method.

Feel free to contact me (Andrew) for questions or suggestions at ajwongphd@gmail.com or jaw6647@psu.edu.
You can also contact Dr. Janik at mjj13@psu.edu for any details as well.
