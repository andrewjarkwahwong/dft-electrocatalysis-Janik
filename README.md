# dft-electrocatalysis-Janik
 Tools supporting recent DFT electrocatalytic work in the Dr. Mike Janik group

The purpose of this repository is to provide tools derived from the models and DFT frameworks for modeling electrocatalytic reactions. 

Tools are, not limited to, Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, excel sheets, and bash scripts for ease of use.
All tools will have the attached paper for further readings about the theory,frameworks, and applications.

# Current tools and manuscripts are as follows:
## Calculating Electrochemical activation barrier and quantifying electrode-electrolyte interfacial effects
    a. [Our paper in Journal of Catalysis can be read here to learn more about the methodology.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021951724000733) 
## Sensitivity analysis of Electrochemical Double Layer (EDL) approximation on electrokinetic predictions: CO* Reduction on Cu
    a. Currently in review at The Journal of Physical Chemistry C.
## Quantifying the Symmetry Factor as a function of the EDL and electronic properties. 
    a. Currently in review at Journal of the American Chemical Society.
